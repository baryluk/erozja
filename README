==== Erozja ===

Erozja is a simple RSS feed reader with GUI, but also RSS agregator which
can be used by other as server, for other clients.

This is Alpha quality software. Not for real usage yet.
See http://wiki.github.com/baryluk/erozja/ for current status and some screenshots.

It is written in Erlang, uses wxWidgets, and works on Linux.

It will be light-weight client/server, which hopefully will scale nicely
to big number of feeds and entries, without any observable CPU load
or GUI latency increase. We target into 200 feeds each with 100 entries
in single GUI instance.




== TODO ==
  * Better Atom parser
  * RDF parser
  * Digg parser (stories/story)
  * Fetch icons for feeds
  * Discover feed names (for Atom simple, for RSS can be harder), and propagate it to subscribers
  * Persistence of setup, feeds, entries(items)
  * Make display more configurable (implement 3 pane view, off/on description)
  * Tooltip when hovering over each tree item with informations like (last update, total itmes, unreaded items, last update status)
  * Implement “item unreaded” flag
  * Implement filtering based on unreaded flag
  * Refresh preview if currently viewed feed have new items
  * HTTP Proxy support
  * Aggregate subscribed feeds using inets http server, to be used in other clients.

== RELEATE WORKS ==
